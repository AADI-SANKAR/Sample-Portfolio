# My First Azure-Hosted Portfolio! 🚀☁️

Hello there! 👋 Welcome to my personal portfolio repository.

This isn't just a regular website; it's my learning playground! 🧪 I built this sample portfolio page specifically to get hands-on experience with **Azure Static Web Apps**. My main goal was to take a project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and understand the process of deploying and hosting it live on the cloud.

I'm super excited to be diving into cloud technologies, and this project is my first big step in that journey. It’s all about learning the deployment pipeline, setting up the service, and seeing the magic happen as my code goes live on the internet for everyone to see! ✨

Thanks for stopping by and checking out my experiment! 😊
